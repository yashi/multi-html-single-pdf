#+Title: Exporting Multiple HTML and a Single PDF

This is a demo code to export multiple HTML files or a single PDF file
from the same multiple Org files.  Org Mode, as of version 9.1.x, does
not have a capability to export to multiple files, ie. each chapter on
each HTML file.

This demo is trying to mimic the capability by using [[https://orgmode.org/org.html#Macro-replacement][Macro replacement]].

Just type =make= should work if your Emacs is setup to use Org Mode,
HTML and latex exporters.

If you have a version of Emacs in somewhere else, just define =EMACS=.

#+begin_example
$ make EMACS=~/src/emacs26/src/emacs
#+end_example

This demo is tested with GNU Emacs 25.2.2 and GNU Emacs 26.0.91.
